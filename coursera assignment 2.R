The first function, makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to

set the value of the vector
get the value of the vector
set the value of the mean
get the value of the mean

makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
  getmean <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setmean = setmean,
       getmean = getmean)
}

The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function
cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getmean()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- mean(data, ...)
  x$setmean(m)
  m
}
Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrixless
Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

Write the following functions:

  makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache
